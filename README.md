>**About**

 `rcognita` is a framework for dynamic programming and reinforcement learning algorithm development, testing, and simulation. The framework offers a playground of ready presets consisting of agents (controllers) and environments (dynamical systems). The core of the framework is `regelum` - a flexible universe of interconnected modules realizing a learn-in-the-loop concept, i.e., learning on the fly via data generated by the system. A distinct feature of `regelum` is that the controllers and systems exist in the same universe, allowing one to assemble a single preset combining both types of entities.
